First component of main path:

    The first CONV2D has F1F1 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be conv_name_base + '2a'. Use 0 as the seed for the random initialization.

'''
The CONV2D layer in the shortcut path is used to resize the input xx to a different dimension, so that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add the shortcut value back to the main path. (This plays a similar role as the matrix WsWs discussed in lecture.) For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2. The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step.

The details of the convolutional block are as follows.

First component of main path:

    The first CONV2D has F1F1 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be conv_name_base + '2a'.
    The first BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis. Its name should be bn_name_base + '2a'.
    Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters.

Second component of main path:

    The second CONV2D has F2F2 filters of (f,f) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "same" and it's name should be conv_name_base + '2b'.
    The second BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis. Its name should be bn_name_base + '2b'.
    Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters.

Third component of main path:

    The third CONV2D has F3F3 filters of (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid" and it's name should be conv_name_base + '2c'.
    The third BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis. Its name should be bn_name_base + '2c'. Note that there is no ReLU activation function in this component.

Shortcut path:

    The CONV2D has F3F3 filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid" and its name should be conv_name_base + '1'.
    The BatchNorm is normalizing the channels axis. Its name should be bn_name_base + '1'.

Final step:

    The shortcut and the main path values are added together.
    Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no name and no hyperparameters.
